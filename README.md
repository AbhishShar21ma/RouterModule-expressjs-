# RouterModule-expressjs-

With the help of two files studen.js and teacher.js I learnt to create a router modeule. 
If a webs-app consist of many sections and we are putting all the seotions in only single file then it becomes very difficult to track the code and also to manage it.

So we use router module.
In this two files router is imported from express and then it exported to main file 'Router.js'.

Now we have accessed all the methods of student.js and teacher.js file in by our Router.js file.
